Understanding the relationship between Google searches and the price of Bitcoin.
In the past 5 years, many have witnessed the enormous swings in cryptocurrency. Since 2015, Bitcoin has rocketed 8500% to the upside. Many smaller traders are looking to take advantage of Bitcoin's (and other cryptocurrencies) lack of liquidity. This is because low liquidity is a barrier to entry for larger quant firms, which eclipse trading opportunites in other liquid markets.
To approach trading bitcoin, I've developed a hypothesis to explain a pattern in the market. I hypothesize that the interest surrounding cryptocurrency is a leading indicator to price moves. Firstly, Bitcoin is a speculative asset. For most investors, it is a bet on potential developments in currency - even though it is currently economically unfeasible due to volatility, liquidity, etc. Second, Bitcoin's price is not driven by an intrinsic value or dividend like equities. 
To test this hypothesis, the first step is to determine the relationship between google searches and bitcoin. The first question I sought to answer was "Does an increase in google searches for the term 'bitcoin' x months ago correlate to a higher bitcoin price in the present?"
In short, I found that google searches in the past might have an influence on bitcoin prices in the present. I am planning on further analyzing this relationship.
