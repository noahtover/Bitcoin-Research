# Bitcoin-Google-Trends-Autocorrelation
Understanding the relationship between Google searches and the price of Bitcoin.
Since 2015, Bitcoin has rocketed 8500% to the upside. Many smaller traders are looking to take advantage of Bitcoin's (and other cryptocurrencies) lack of liquidity. This is because low liquidity is a barrier to entry for larger quant firms, which eclipse trading opportunites in other liquid markets.
To approach trading bitcoin, I've developed a hypothesis to explain a pattern in the market. I hypothesize that the interest surrounding cryptocurrency is a leading indicator to price moves. Firstly, Bitcoin is a speculative asset. For most investors, it is a bet on potential developments in currency - even though it is currently economically unfeasible due to volatility, liquidity, etc. Second, Bitcoin's price is not driven by an intrinsic value or dividend like equities.
In short, I found that changes in Bitcoin price may cause interest. This is because the granger causality test produced a low p value for this result. The granger causality test aims to predict a time series with a lagged version of the other. Also, visually Bitcoin moves before Google trends data.
