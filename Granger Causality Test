## Next, I am going to run the granger causaulity test to determine the p value and therefore potential causality.
## First, I am going to transform the data to stationary. Differencing will not work on its own because there would still be a non constant variance. So I am using log10 as well to reduce variability.

grangertest(x = dhits, y = dclose, order = 3) # Predicts monthly bitcoin with lags of search interest.
# Considering the results of the granger test, bitcoin may cause interest. This could be because people chase returns, and the large rallies in Bitcoin draw them to invest.
